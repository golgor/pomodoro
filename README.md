# pomodoro
Repo for making a pomodoro timer.

Intention is to have a project to practice what I have learnt from Python-courses as well courses in selfimprovement / Monotasking.

# Timers
## Pomodoro
* Divide work time into 25-minute chunks called pomodoros — named after the tomato-shaped timer the inventor used to track his time.
* After each pomodoro, take a five-minute break.
* After four pomodoros, take a longer break — fifteen to thirty minutes or until you feel refreshed. Then repeat the cycle.

## 52–17 rule

* Work for 52 minutes
* Break for 17 minutes

## Ultradian Rhythms
https://medium.com/better-humans/avoid-burnout-and-increase-awareness-using-ultradian-rhythms-5e64158e7e19
* for every 90 minute work period, you should take 20 minutes of break time.

## Ideas
* Using YAML for configuration
* Pysimplegui as a GUI (https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Possible to use Django or Flask (Flask probably preferable due to simplicity)
* Use Click (Python lib) for CLI
