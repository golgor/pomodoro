# pomodoro
Repo for making a pomodoro timer.

Intention is to have a project to practice what I have learnt from Python-courses as well courses in selfimprovement / Monotasking.

## Ideas
* Pomodoro timer, working for 40 minutes, 10 minute brake...?
* Using YAML for configuration
* Pysimplegui as a GUI
* Extern device connected via USB (arduino) to control red/green lamp
* Possible to have guy using Django or Flask (Flask probably preferable due to simplicity)
