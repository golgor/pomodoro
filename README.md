# pomodoro
Repo for making a pomodoro timer.

Intention is to have a project to practice what I have learnt from Python-courses as well courses in selfimprovement / Monotasking.

## Ideas
* Pomodoro timer, working for 40 minutes, 10 minute brake...?
* Using YAML for configuration
* Pysimplegui as a GUI (https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Extern device connected via USB (arduino) to control red/green lamp
* Possible to have guy using Django or Flask (Flask probably preferable due to simplicity)
* Use Click (Python lib) for CLI

## Other
### PySimpleGUI
To install pysimplegui in an Anaconda dist, run the following command:

conda install -c conda-forge pysimplegui
